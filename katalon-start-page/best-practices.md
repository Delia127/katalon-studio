### [Tackle Object Selector Flakiness with Self-Healing Mechanism](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/self-healing.html)

Once the broken object is self-healed, the alternative locator finding the object is used for that particular broken Test Object for the remaining execution. This helps shorten execution time by preventing self-healing from taking place again and again with the same broken object.

### [Record Headless Execution](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/screenshots-videos.html#browser-based-video-recorder)

With Screen-based Recorder, you can capture what's visible on the screen, while with the Browser-based Video Recorder, you can record videos of Headless browser. You can also record video of a browser window only (even it's hidden behind another window) or videos of multiple browsers simultaneously in parallel execution.
