### [Tackle Object Selector Flakiness with Self-Healing Mechanism](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/self-healing.html)

Once the broken object is self-healed, the alternative locator finding the object is used for that particular broken Test Object for the remaining execution. This helps shorten execution time by preventing self-healing from taking place again and again with the same broken object.
