### [Curious about what's new in v7.9?](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/new/what-is-new.html)

For macOS users with previous versions, you will not be able to use **Check for updates...** to upgrade to v7.9+ due to the core engine upgrade (but you can use **Check for updates...** in v7.9 and later). Please download the latest version from [our website](https://www.katalon.com/download/). To reuse Preferences from previous versions, refer to [this guide](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/katalon-studio-preferences.html#import-preferences).
